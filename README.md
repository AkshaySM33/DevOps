<!-- Purpose of README.md: Use README.md to tell others why your project is useful, what it does, how to use it, and where to get help. It's the first thing people see when visiting your repo. Include sections like:

What the project does
Why itâ€™s useful
Getting started instructions
Where users can get help
Who maintains the project
Formatting with Markdown: GitHub README files use Markdown, which lets you easily add headings, code blocks, tables, images, and more. For example:

Headings: # Title, ## Subtitle
Lists: - Item 1, - Item 2
Code: `code`
Tables:
Code
| Rank | Languages |
|-----:|-----------|
|    1 | JavaScript|
|    2 | Python    |
Images: ![Alt text](image-url)
Links: [Link text](url)
Relative Links and Images: Link to other files in your repo using relative paths. For example, [Contribution guidelines](docs/CONTRIBUTING.md).

Advanced Formatting: You can add collapsed sections (<details>), quotes (> quote), and comments (<!-- comment -->).

Saving and Previewing: After editing, preview your README and commit the changes.
